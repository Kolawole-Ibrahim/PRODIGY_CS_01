"Implement Caesar Cipher" 
Create a Python program that can encrypt and Decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher ALgorithm.
Allowing users to input a message and a shift value to perform Encrytion and Decryption 

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encrypting messages, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to protect his military communications. This technique involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of places. For example, with a shift of three, the letter ‘A’ becomes ‘D’, ‘B’ becomes ‘E’, and so on. Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher formed the groundwork for modern cryptographic techniques.
Thus to cipher a given text we need an integer value, known as a shift which indicates the number of positions each letter of the text has been moved down. Read more
