"Implement Caesar Cipher" 
Create a Python program that can encrypt and Decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher ALgorithm.
Allowing users to input a message and a shift value to perform Encrytion and Decryption 

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encrypting messages, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to protect his military communications. This technique involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of places. For example, with a shift of three, the letter ‘A’ becomes ‘D’, ‘B’ becomes ‘E’, and so on. Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher formed the groundwork for modern cryptographic techniques.
Thus to cipher a given text we need an integer value, known as a shift which indicates the number of positions each letter of the text has been moved down. Read more on https://github.com/Kolawole-Ibrahim/PRODIGY_CS_01/blob/main/Caesar%20Cipher.txt

When we double-click on the python file, it opens the interface below.

it Prompt the User to choose either to Encrypt(E) or Decrypt(D)
Then it prompt the user to Enter text to Encrypt or Decrypt and the Shift value.

There! we have our Encrypted Text.
